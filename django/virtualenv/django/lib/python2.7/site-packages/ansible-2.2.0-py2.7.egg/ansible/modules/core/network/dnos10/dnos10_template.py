module: dnos10_template
version_added: "2.2"
author: "Senthil Kumar Ganesan (@skg_net)"
short_description: Manage Dell OS10 device configurations over SSH.
description:
  - Manages Dell OS10 network device configurations over SSH.  This module
    allows implementors to work with the device running-config.  It
    provides a way to push a set of commands onto a network device
    by evaluating the current running-config and only pushing configuration
    commands that are not already configured.  The config source can
    be a set of commands or a template.
extends_documentation_fragment: dnos10
options:
  src:
    description:
      - The path to the config source.  The source can be either a
        file with config or a template that will be merged during
        runtime.  By default the task will first search for the source
        file in role or playbook root folder in templates unless a full
        path to the file is given.
    required: true
  force:
    description:
      - The force argument instructs the module not to consider the
        current device running-config.  When set to true, this will
        cause the module to push the contents of I(src) into the device
        without first checking if already configured. This argument is
        mutually exclusive with O(config).
    required: false
    default: false
    choices: [ "true", "false" ]
  backup:
    description:
      - When this argument is configured true, the module will backup
        the running-config from the node prior to making any changes.
        The backup file will be written to backup_{{ hostname }} in
        the root of the playbook directory. This argument is
        mutually exclusive with O(config).

    required: false
    default: false
    choices: [ "true", "false" ]
  config:
    description:
      - The module, by default, will connect to the remote device and
        retrieve the current running-config to use as a base for comparing
        against the contents of source.  There are times when it is not
        desirable to have the task get the current running-config for
        every task.  The I(config) argument allows the implementer to
        pass in the configuration to use as the base config for
        comparison. This argument is mutually exclusive with
        O(force) and O(backup).

    required: false
    default: null
